### I am a Security Engineer, Consultant, and Leader with skills in Cloud Security, Application Security, Detection Engineering, and Automation. 

![alt text](img/headshot.jpg) 

I have worked at startups, large enterprises, FAANG, and the Federal Government helping customers solve security engineering challenges, as both a consultant, and owner. I enjoy getting to solve large scale challenges with both code and strategy, and enabling engineering teams to move fast without having to worry about security. I deeply care about making the right thing as easy as possible, and the end user experience of security.

I prefer environments that reward creative thinking, strong ownership of problems, and data driven decision making. 

While I enjoy going deep on technical problems, I love being able to step back and solve problems at the source vs bandaid fixes.
